# Java Practice Repository

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tanmay Mahajan, and this is my personal Java programming repository.  
I've recently started learning Java and will be uploading my work here regularly as I practice and build my skills.



- Basic Java programs (loops, conditionals, arrays, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts (OOP)
- Simple projects and assignments
- Experimenting with Java features as I learn them

## ðŸ“… Updated Regularly
Iâ€™ll be pushing my code regularly to track my progress and stay consistent.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure (May Change Over Time)
